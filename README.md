Outlook sucks, so this is a tool to use your own e-mail client, even if your organisation doesn't allow 3rd party email clients, allowing you to imitate different apps and offering multiple ways to integrate with your own mail client.

Only requirement is being able to use outlook.office365.com (which I assume you do, cuz what emails would you else want to read ig).

Imitates Outlook Web (OWA) and (ab)uses the Outlook REST API to create a bridge via IMAP and SMTP
